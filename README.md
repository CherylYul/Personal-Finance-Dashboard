# MY FINANCIAL FREEDOM JOURNEY
 
 This is my basic PowerBi finance dashboard, data collected from the time I start record which is 2021 August untill the day I post it 2022 Mar. I hope I can share my small experience in managing personal finance with everyone.
 
 Financial freedom is one thing that most people pursuit, but lots of people cannot achieve it in their whole life.

 I am not the one who step into this journey very soon, the time I started was 2021 when I was 21, fortunately, it's not too late.

 I used to go to work part-time for a company then realize my passion was not in this field. To change the current job and pursuit my passion is not easy, I stucked in University study tuition and also living expenses. At this time, I realize the resistance of money is big.

 Then, I went to meet and elderly friends to ask for advice. He told me his story that he would like to stop his business for a while to study and experience new things, but how about the other employees working in company now? The problem here is freedom.

 Untill one day, I found Hieu TV channel, he show me 4 stages in the journey to financial freedom:

 1. In high pressure and insecurity:
 * Debt: student who borrow money from school, bank or government to finish their university
 * Financial dependent: need support from family
 * Self-survival: the earning money is just enough for spending, or earn much then spend much

 2. Enlighten:
 * Monitor spending: record spending and earning, recognize the minimum expense and standard expense
 * Take actions: handle debt
 * Set up cash flow: allocate money to savings, expenses and other accounts, building emergency and sinking fund.

3. Accumulate and invest:
* Recruit money: a good builders are the person who know how to earn much and spend less.
* Passive income: building multiple source of income
* Invest: building portfolio model and manage it

4. Financial freedom:
* Financial security: have enough money to live untill final day in life if not spend too much
* Financial independent: have enough money to live untill final day in life without any restriction in spending
* Financial freedom: completely detached from money, use money to serve other goal

Knowing clearly where you are in each stage help a lot to sketch out your plan to pursue financial freedom
